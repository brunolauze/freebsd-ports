The Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) is a simple framework for embedding 
Chromium-based browsers in other applications. It is a BSD-licensed open 
source project founded by Marshall Greenblatt in 2008 and based on the Google 
Chromium project. Unlike the Chromium project itself, which focuses mainly on 
Google Chrome application development, CEF focuses on facilitating embedded 
browser use cases in third-party applications. CEF insulates the user from the 
underlying Chromium and Blink code complexity by offering production-quality 
stable APIs, release branches tracking specific Chromium releases, and binary 
distributions. Most features in CEF have default implementations that provide 
rich functionality while requiring little or no integration work from the user. 
There are currently over 100 million installed instances of CEF around the world 
embedded in products from a wide range of companies and industries. A partial 
list of companies and products using CEF is available on the CEF Wikipedia page. 
Some use cases for CEF include:

Embedding an HTML5-compliant Web browser control in an existing native 
application.

Creating a light-weight native shell application that hosts a user interface 
developed primarily using Web technologies.

Rendering Web content off-screen in applications that have their own custom drawing 
frameworks.

Acting as a host for automated testing of existing Web properties and applications.
